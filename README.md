# Fast Excel Hex Analyzer

Fast Excel Hex Analyzer is a program for Microsoft Excel that allows you to view files in HEX format, quickly navigate through data, and perform color highlighting on desired bytes.

---

## Features

- View and navigate files in HEX format.
- Jump to the desired offset.
- Support for color highlighting (tags) for specific bytes.

---

## Limitations

Please note that the program is intended for working with very small files (up to ~5 MB), as loading larger files can take significant time and may cause Excel to hang.

---

## Requirements

- Microsoft Excel (with macros enabled).
- Windows (recommended for full compatibility with VBA macros).

---

## Installation

1. Download the Excel file from the repository.
2. Open the file in Excel.
3. Enable macros when prompted.
4. Start working with the data by clicking the **"Open hex tool"** button.

## How to Use

1. Click the **"Open hex tool"** button on the current sheet in Excel.
2. In the main application form, click the **"Load file"** button to load data from a file in HEX format. In the opened window, select the desired file and wait for the data to fully load into the Excel table until the message **"File loaded successfully."** appears (this may take considerable time depending on the file size).
3. To delete the data and all associated tags, click the **"Delete data"** button.
4. After loading the data, you can add tags (see the next section) for quick byte highlighting; they will be displayed in both the Edit Panel and the Decoded Text Panel.

## Go To

Navigating by byte offsets is done using a separate window that can be opened by clicking the **"GoTo"** button on the main form. Select a single cell, then choose where to start counting the new offsetâ€”from the beginning of the file or from the position of the currently selected cell. Enter in the text field how many bytes to move in HEX format (the value in DEC format will be displayed above it). Click the **"Move to"** button to jump to the new position.

---

## Tags

1. Select a range of cells, either in the Edit Panel or the Decoded Text Panel.
2. ### To Create a Tag:
   - In the main frame, enter your tag description in the **(Enter the tag description)** field.
   - Choose a color for displaying the tag by entering the necessary RGB values or in HEX format.
   - Click the **"Set tag"** button to apply the tag, or **"Delete tag"** to remove the tag from the selected cells.
